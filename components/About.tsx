        About Me
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        I transitioned into frontend development from a background in
        Physiology, bringing a strong analytical mindset and attention
        to systems. I enjoy turning ideas into usable, well-structured
        products and continuously improving my craft through real-world
        projects.
